Project 2 Requirements:
<ol>
    <li>This service does not manage a to-do list; it is a scheduler similar to When2Meet</li>
    <li>This project is using MySql to store long-term data</li>
    <li>This project is using Express</li>
    <li>My project is available at https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/</li>
    <li>All endpoints and parameters are approriately named</li>
    <li>All data sent and received are complex JSON data</b></li>
    <li>All CRUD operations are supported</b></li>
    <li>The firewall is active and enabled on system startup. All ports are blocked except for 22, 80, 443, and 8443
    </li>
    <li>Nginx server supports this web service</li>
    <li>My web service uses custom middleware and an options wildcard endpoint</li>
    <li>My web service is running via pm2</li>
    <li>I have sent you my GitHub repository through direct message in Slack</li>
    <li>Database and schema are included in the repo; password is in a credentials.json file not in the repo</li>
    <li>Progress on my Git repo starts October 25</li>
    <li>This page is accessed by appending /report.html</li>

This web server works similarly to When2Meet. Each databse entry has a unique id, as well as a first_name, start_time,
end_time, week_day, and is_deleted. The idea is that a user will add to the database the times that they are busy
and their friends are able to see these times, too.<br><br>
Currently, the database (named 'schedule') contains:
<code>{"id":1,"first_name":"John","start_time":"14:00:00","end_time":"17:30:00","week_day":"Wednesday","is_deleted":0}</code><br>
This web server has insert, update, patch and delete endpoints. To test my endpoints:<br>
<br>For INSERT, add to the schedule database like this:<br>
<code>curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \</code><br>
<code>--data '{"first_name": "Jane", "start_time": "8:00", "end_time": "10:45", "week_day": "Tuesday", "is_deleted": 0}' \</code><br>
<code>https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule</code>
<br> The id is serial, so don't worry about specifiying one for the new entry (MySql will do it for you).<br>
<br>For SELECT, there are a few options:<br>
You can <code>curl https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule</code> to see all schedule entries<br>
Or <code>curl https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/John/Wednesday</code> to see a specific user's schedule for a
specific day<br>
<code>curl https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/user/John</code> for a user's schedule<br>
Similarly, <code>curl https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/id/1</code> to search via an entry id<br>
Then lastly, <code>curl https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/day/Wednesday</code> to see schedules for a chosen day<br>
<br>For UPDATE, here is an example of updating the start and end times for Jane:<br>
<code>curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \</code><br>
<code>--request PATCH \</code><br>
<code>--data '{"first_name": "Jane", "start_time": "8:15", "end_time": "11:00", "week_day": "Tuesday"}' \</code><br>
<code>https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/2</code><br>
Note that the entry id is needed to update the schedule.<br>
<br>For DELETE, only the schedule entry id should be specified:<br>
<code>curl --request DELETE \</code><br>
<code>https://project2.le-sage.me:8443/schedule/1</code>
